# youtube-dl-server 2.0.0

## This is currently a work in progress. The entire program is being rewritten from scratch, using C++ instead of Python this time. It will also use `yt-dlp` instead of `youtube-dl`. The method of communication between the browser and server will also be different, as this time it will be via an API instead of through weirdly done fetches after the page has been served.

## TODO:

- Create the back end API

- Create the front end default webpage
